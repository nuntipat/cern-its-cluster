This example demonstrates the usage of the low speed interface of
default firmware (i.e. it runs with default firmware).

The core of the low speed interface can be found in
$(ZTEXPREFIX)/default/fpga-fx3/ezusb_io.v (for FX3) and
$(ZTEXPREFIX)/default/fpga-fx2/ezusb_io.v (for FX2), respectively.
It has an SRAM like port with a 8 bit address and 32 bit data width.

The host software writes 2 numbers to address 0 and 1, the FPGA sum these
numbers. The result can be read back from the host through address 2 of the
low speed interface.

User should edit the $(ZTEXPREFIX) variable in the Makefile and the batch/shell
script to match the ZTEX SDK installation directory in their development machine.
